4. Route Details (Winter Specifics)
The winter route follows the summer trail initially but deviates significantly near treeline.

Lower Mountain: Follow the standard trail through the trees. If the trail is buried, navigation may be required, but a trench is usually present.

Treeline Deviation (CRITICAL): Around 11,800 ft, the summer trail traverses left (South) across the face. DO NOT FOLLOW THIS IN WINTER. It crosses avalanche terrain.

Winter Line: Instead of traversing left, continue hiking straight up the spine of the East Ridge. Stick to the wind-scoured crest. It is steeper but safer.

Upper Mountain: Follow the ridge crest over "The Catwalk" and up the final steep pitch to the summit.

Descent: Retrace the ascent route strictly. Do not drop into the bowls on either side (Cristo Couloir to the south or the North Bowl) unless explicitly planned and assessed for avalanche risk.

5. Hazards & Risk Management
Avalanche Danger:

Mitigation: We will check the CAIC forecast (Colorado Avalanche Information Center) the evening before. We will stay on the ridge crest and avoid the summer traverse and the Cristo Couloir.

Cold & Wind:

Mitigation: Quandary is famous for high winds. We will bring full face protection (balaclava/goggles) and turn around if frostbite becomes a risk.

Navigation:

Mitigation: The trail may be blown over. We will carry a GPS/Phone with offline maps (e.g., Gaia, CalTopo) and a backup battery.

Solitude:

Mitigation: Unlike summer, there are fewer people. We stay together as a team. No splitting up.

6. Gear Checklist (Mandatory)
Footwear: Insulated winter hiking boots (No summer trail runners).

Traction: Microspikes (required) AND Snowshoes (required to be in the car; we will decide at the trailhead if we need to carry them based on trench conditions).

Clothing:

Hardshell jacket (Windproof is vital).

Hardshell/Softshell pants.

Puffy jacket (Down/Synthetic) for breaks.

Base layers (No cotton).

Ski Goggles (Critical for wind).

Warm Gloves + Mittens (backup).

Safety:

Headlamp + Spare batteries.

Sunscreen/Sunglasses (Snow blindness risk).

Satellite Messenger (e.g., Garmin inReach) if available.

2 Liters of water (in insulated bottles or hydration hose insulated).

7. Emergency Protocol
In case of separation: Stop, wait 15 minutes. If no contact, blow whistle. Retrace steps to last known contact point.

In case of injury: Stabilize patient. Keep warm (use puffy jackets/bivvy). Call 911 or trigger SOS on satellite device.

Nearest Hospital: St. Anthony Summit Medical Center (Frisco, CO).

Search and Rescue: Summit County Rescue Group.
