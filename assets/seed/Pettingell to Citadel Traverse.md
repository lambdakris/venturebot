### **Rappel**

There are two potential anchor points. There is a "high anchor" at the top of the cliff band (reqs 60 ft) and a "lower anchor" located further down on a ledge (reqs 30 ft). There are conflicting reports about the lower anchor. It sounds like most people on 14ers use the lower anchor, but it does involve a sketchy downclimb and a sketchy anchor area where each climber would need do safety in and move around carefully.

Here are some links on the rappel:

### **Rappel Procedure: A Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Survey:** Look for and identify potential rappel stations while remaining safe.  
2. **Anchor:** Arrive at the rappel station. The first person to the anchor secures themselves directly to it with a personal anchor system. They assess the anchor and reinforce or rebuild it as necessary with the team's fresh material.  
3. **Setup:** The rope is threaded through the rappel ring or chains. The middle point of the rope should be at the anchor. Tie secure stopper knots (e.g., a double overhand) in **both** ends of the rope. Toss the rope ends down the cliff, watching for loose rock.  
4. **Rappeller Setup:** The first person to descend sets up their rappel device on both strands of the rope and adds a friction hitch (e.g., an autoblock) as a backup. They double-check their system.  
5. **Communication:** Use clear, standardized commands. The rappeller announces, "On Rappel\!" before weighting the rope.  
6. **Descent:** The first person rappels smoothly, avoiding dislodging rocks. Upon reaching the ground, they move away from the base of the cliff and announce, "Off Rappel\!"  
7. **Subsequent Rappellers:** The next person does not begin their setup until the previous person is safely off the rope.  
8. **Pulling the Rope:** The last person to rappel is responsible for pulling the rope. After announcing they are "Off Rappel," they should move to a safe position, untie the stopper knots, and pull one strand of the rope. Pulling smoothly and steadily helps prevent the rope from snagging on rock features.

### **Bailouts**

This traverse has several logical decision points and escape routes.

* **Bailout 1 (On Citadel's East Ridge):** If the party struggles with the Class 4 gully or is falling behind schedule, the simplest and safest retreat is to downclimb the ridge back to the Citadel-Bethel saddle and descend the social trail back to Herman Lake and the main trail.  
* **Bailout 2 (On the Traverse, Before Rappel):** This is the most committed section of the route. Descending the steep gullies directly off the ridge is not recommended. The safest, though psychologically difficult, option is to reverse the route, scrambling back over The Citadel's summits and down the East Ridge.  
* **Bailout 3 (After the Rappel):** If the party is exhausted, behind schedule, or faced with deteriorating weather after the rappel, the best option is to forgo the ascent of Pettingell Peak. From the low saddle between The Citadel and Pettingell, descend directly east down the tundra and scree slopes into the basin below, rejoining the Herman Gulch trail near the lake. This is a common and sensible shortcut.1

## **Emergency Plan**

### **C. Emergency Action Plan (EAP)**

In the event of a serious incident, a clear, systematic response can save lives.

1. **Scene Safety:** First, ensure the scene is safe for rescuers. Move the patient out of the path of any potential rockfall or other immediate hazard, if possible without causing further injury.  
2. **First Aid:** Provide immediate first aid to the level of the party's training. Stop any major bleeding, assess breathing, and stabilize injuries as best as possible.  
3. **Determine Location:** Pinpoint your exact location using a GPS device or a mapping app on a phone. Obtain latitude and longitude coordinates.  
4. **Call for Help:** The most reliable method is to activate the SOS function on a satellite messenger (e.g., Garmin inReach, SPOT). If cell service is available (unlikely but possible), call 911\.  
5. **Provide Information:** When communicating with dispatch, provide the following critical information clearly and calmly:  
   * Your precise location (coordinates).  
   * The number of people in your party and the number injured.  
   * The nature of the emergency and the patient's condition.  
   * The equipment you have (e.g., rope, warm clothing, shelter).  
6. **Stay Put:** Do not move from your location unless instructed to do so by the rescue team. This makes it easier for them to find you. Prepare the patient for a potentially long wait by keeping them warm and comfortable.
