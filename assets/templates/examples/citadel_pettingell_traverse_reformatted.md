## Route

### Map

https://caltopo.com/m/AGVCC

### Overview

The traverse ascends The Citadel via its East Ridge (Class 4 gully), crosses over the summit, then continues along an exposed and committing ridge to Pettingell Peak. A mandatory rappel (30-60 ft depending on anchor) is required at the low point between the two peaks. The route offers excellent scrambling with significant exposure.

**Committing Nature:** The section between The Citadel and Pettingell is the most committed part of the route. Reversing the traverse after starting is difficult and time-consuming.

### Detailed Route Plan

**Timing:**
- Sunrise: 05:54 AM
- Turnaround Times:
  - 09:30 AM if not yet on Citadel summit
  - 10:30 AM if not yet past the rappel
- Weather Window: 12:00 PM (afternoon storms)
- Sunset: 08:20 PM

### Technical Sections

#### Rappel Information

**Location:** Low point between The Citadel and Pettingell Peak, after descending from Citadel summit

**Anchor Options:**
1. **High Anchor:** At top of cliff band
   - Requires: 60 ft (60m rope)
   - Straightforward setup
   - Clean rappel

2. **Lower Anchor:** On a ledge partway down
   - Requires: 30 ft (30m rope sufficient)
   - Requires sketchy downclimb to reach anchor
   - Sketchy anchor area requiring careful movement
   - Most parties on 14ers.com use this option despite challenges

**Additional Beta:**
- https://www.14ers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=58503
- Conflicting reports about lower anchor quality and safety

#### Rappel Procedure: Step-by-Step

1. **Survey:** Look for and identify potential rappel stations while remaining safe.

2. **Anchor:** Arrive at the rappel station. First person to anchor secures themselves directly to it with personal anchor system (PAS). Assess anchor and reinforce/rebuild as necessary with team's fresh material.

3. **Setup:** Thread rope through rappel ring or chains. Middle point of rope should be at anchor. Tie secure stopper knots (e.g., double overhand) in BOTH ends of rope. Toss rope ends down cliff, watching for loose rock.

4. **Rappeller Setup:** First person to descend sets up rappel device on both strands of rope and adds friction hitch (e.g., autoblock) as backup. Double-check system.

5. **Communication:** Use clear, standardized commands. Rappeller announces "On Rappel!" before weighting rope.

6. **Descent:** First person rappels smoothly, avoiding dislodging rocks. Upon reaching ground, move away from base of cliff and announce "Off Rappel!"

7. **Subsequent Rappellers:** Next person does not begin setup until previous person is safely off rope.

8. **Pulling the Rope:** Last person to rappel is responsible for pulling rope. After announcing "Off Rappel," move to safe position, untie stopper knots, and pull one strand of rope. Pull smoothly and steadily to prevent snagging on rock features.

### Bailout Options

This traverse has several logical decision points and escape routes.

**Bailout 1 (On Citadel's East Ridge):**
- **When:** If party struggles with Class 4 gully or is falling behind schedule
- **How:** Downclimb the ridge back to Citadel-Bethel saddle, descend social trail back to Herman Lake and main trail
- **Why:** Simplest and safest retreat before committed traverse section

**Bailout 2 (On the Traverse, Before Rappel):**
- **When:** On committed section before rappel; weather deteriorating or party struggling
- **How:** Reverse the route, scrambling back over The Citadel's summit and down East Ridge
- **Why:** Safest option, though psychologically difficult and time-consuming
- **Note:** Descending steep gullies directly off ridge NOT recommended

**Bailout 3 (After the Rappel):**
- **When:** Exhausted, behind schedule, or deteriorating weather after rappel; decide to forgo Pettingell summit
- **How:** From low saddle between Citadel and Pettingell, descend directly east down tundra and scree slopes into basin, rejoin Herman Gulch trail near lake
- **Why:** Common and sensible shortcut if conditions warrant

## Emergency Information

### Emergency Action Plan

In the event of a serious incident:

1. **Scene Safety:** First, ensure scene is safe for rescuers. Move patient out of path of potential rockfall or other immediate hazard, if possible without causing further injury.

2. **First Aid:** Provide immediate first aid to level of party's training. Stop major bleeding, assess breathing, stabilize injuries as best as possible.

3. **Determine Location:** Pinpoint exact location using GPS device or mapping app. Obtain latitude and longitude coordinates.

4. **Call for Help:** Most reliable method is to activate SOS function on satellite messenger (e.g., Garmin inReach, SPOT). If cell service available (unlikely but possible), call 911.

5. **Provide Information:** When communicating with dispatch, provide following critical information clearly and calmly:
   - Your precise location (coordinates)
   - Number of people in party and number injured
   - Nature of emergency and patient's condition
   - Equipment you have (e.g., rope, warm clothing, shelter)

6. **Stay Put:** Do not move from location unless instructed by rescue team. This makes it easier for them to find you. Prepare patient for potentially long wait by keeping them warm and comfortable.
