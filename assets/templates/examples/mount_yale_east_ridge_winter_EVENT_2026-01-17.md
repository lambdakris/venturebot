## Current Conditions Assessment

**Last Checked:** January 5, 2026 (12 days before trip)

**Links:**
- NOAA: https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=38.8444&lon=-106.3133
- Mountain Forecast: https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Yale/forecasts/4196
- OpenSnow: https://opensnow.com/location/buena-vista-co-us

**To check (when available):**
- [ ] Temperature range (highs/lows)
- [ ] Wind speed/direction above treeline
- [ ] Precipitation chance
- [ ] Wind chill values
- [ ] Cloud cover

**Abort criteria:**
- Extreme cold (wind chills below -10°F at summit)
- High winds (sustained >30 mph or gusts >50 mph above treeline)
- Whiteout conditions / heavy snow
- Storm system arriving during trip window

### Avalanche Forecast

**Current CAIC Sawatch Range forecast:** Moderate danger (early January, post-storm)

**January 17 forecast:** NOT YET AVAILABLE
- CAIC issues daily forecasts
- Will check starting January 15

**Link:**
- CAIC Sawatch: https://avalanche.state.co.us/forecasts/backcountry-avalanche/sawatch-range

**Current (early January):** Recent storm depositing snow

**To check via SNOTEL:**
- [ ] Current snow depth at Buena Vista station
- [ ] Recent accumulation (last 7 days)
- [ ] Temperature trends (freeze-thaw cycles?)

**Link:**
- SNOTEL Buena Vista: [Link in META plan]

**Trail breaking concerns:**
- If massive fresh snow without consolidation: exhausting trail breaking
- Check for recent trip reports after this week's storm
