## Route

### Map

[CalTopo link to be added]

### Overview

The winter route follows the standard trail initially but deviates significantly near treeline to avoid avalanche terrain. The route stays on the wind-scoured East Ridge crest rather than traversing left (south) across the face as the summer trail does.

**Key Navigation Points:**
- Lower mountain follows summer trail through trees (may need to navigate if buried)
- **CRITICAL DEVIATION at ~11,800 ft:** Do NOT follow summer trail's left traverse - this crosses avalanche terrain in winter
- **Winter line:** Continue straight up the spine of the East Ridge on wind-scoured crest (steeper but safer)
- Upper mountain follows ridge crest over "The Catwalk" and up final steep pitch to summit

### Detailed Route Plan

**Timing:**
- Start Time: 06:00 AM (hard start)
- Sunrise: [TBD based on date]
- Turnaround Time: 11:00 AM (strict, regardless of position)
- Return to Cars: 02:00 PM (target)
- Notify Emergency Contacts: 02:30 PM

**Decision Points:**
- **Decision Point 1 (Treeline ~11,700 ft):** Assess weather/wind conditions
- **Decision Point 2 (The Catwalk):** Final assessment before summit push

| Segment | Destination/Waypoint | Distance | Elevation Change | Description | Est. Duration | Start Time | End Time |
|---------|---------------------|----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Trailhead to Treeline | ~11,700 ft | ~2.5 mi | +885 ft | Follow standard trail through trees; navigation may be required if buried but trench usually present | 1.5 hrs | 06:00 AM | 07:30 AM |
| Decision Point 1 | Treeline ~11,700 ft | | | Assess weather and wind; decide whether to continue | 5 min | 07:30 AM | 07:35 AM |
| Treeline to Catwalk | ~13,100 ft | ~1.5 mi | +1,400 ft | Continue straight up East Ridge spine on wind-scoured crest (do NOT traverse left) | 1.5 hrs | 07:35 AM | 09:05 AM |
| Decision Point 2 | The Catwalk ~13,100 ft | | | Assess conditions; final decision point before summit push | 5 min | 09:05 AM | 09:10 AM |
| Catwalk to Summit | 14,265 ft | ~0.8 mi | +1,165 ft | Follow ridge crest up final steep pitch to summit | 1 hr 20 min | 09:10 AM | 10:30 AM |
| Summit | 14,265 ft | | | Spend max 20 mins depending on wind | 20 min | 10:30 AM | 10:50 AM |
| Summit to Trailhead | Trailhead | ~3.3 mi | -3,450 ft | Retrace ascent route strictly; do NOT drop into bowls on either side | 3+ hrs | 10:50 AM | 02:00 PM |

### Route Details (Winter-Specific)

**Lower Mountain:**
Follow the standard trail through the trees. If the trail is buried, navigation may be required, but a trench is usually present from prior parties.

**Treeline Deviation (CRITICAL - ~11,800 ft):**
Around 11,800 ft, the summer trail traverses left (south) across the face. **DO NOT FOLLOW THIS IN WINTER.** It crosses avalanche terrain.

**Winter Line:**
Instead of traversing left, continue hiking straight up the spine of the East Ridge. Stick to the wind-scoured crest. It is steeper but safer.

**Upper Mountain:**
Follow the ridge crest over "The Catwalk" and up the final steep pitch to the summit.

**Descent:**
Retrace the ascent route strictly. Do not drop into the bowls on either side (Cristo Couloir to the south or the North Bowl) unless explicitly planned and assessed for avalanche risk.

1. **Scene Safety:** Ensure scene is safe for rescuers. Move patient from immediate hazards if possible without causing further injury.
2. **First Aid:** Provide immediate care - stop bleeding, assess breathing, stabilize injuries.
3. **Determine Location:** Get precise coordinates using GPS/phone.
4. **Call for Help:**
   - Activate SOS on satellite messenger (if available)
   - Call 911 if cell service available
5. **Provide Information:**
   - Exact location (coordinates)
   - Number in party, number injured
   - Nature of emergency and patient condition
   - Equipment available (warm clothing, shelter)
6. **Stay Put:** Do not move unless instructed by rescue team. Keep patient warm (use puffy jackets, bivy).

**In Case of Separation:**
- Stop, wait 15 minutes
- If no contact, blow whistle
- Retrace steps to last known contact point

**In Case of Injury:**
- Stabilize patient
- Keep warm (use puffy jackets/bivy)
- Call 911 or trigger SOS on satellite device

## Objective Hazards

- **Avalanche Danger:**
  - Mitigation: Check CAIC forecast evening before. Stay on ridge crest. Avoid summer traverse and Cristo Couloir.

- **Cold & Wind:**
  - Mitigation: Quandary is famous for high winds. Bring full face protection (balaclava/goggles). Turn around if frostbite becomes a risk.

- **Navigation:**
  - Mitigation: Trail may be blown over. Carry GPS/phone with offline maps and backup battery.

- **Solitude:**
  - Mitigation: Unlike summer, fewer people in winter. Stay together as team. No splitting up.
