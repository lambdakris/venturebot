## Route Description

### Overview

**Total Distance:** 10.5 miles round trip
**Elevation Gain:** 5,000 ft (9,400 → 14,196 ft)
**Typical Duration:** 8-10 hours (winter is slower than summer)

**Route Character:**
- Non-technical scrambling (Class 2)
- Long approach on Colorado Trail
- Ridge climbing above treeline
- Loose rock in sections
- Considerable route-finding required

### Turn-by-Turn

**Segment 1: Trailhead to Ridge Junction (3.25 mi, ~2-3 hours)**
- Start: Avalanche Trailhead (9,400 ft)
- Follow Colorado Trail northward
- Well-defined trail through forest
- Gain ~2,500 ft to reach open ridge area around 11,900 ft
- **Winter note:** Trail may be snow-covered; look for trench from previous parties

**Segment 2: Ridge Junction to East Ridge Access (~0.5 mi, ~30-45 min)**
- Leave main Colorado Trail at ~11,900 ft
- Traverse west to access Yale's east ridge
- Route-finding becomes important here
- **Winter note:** GPS/offline maps essential; snow obscures trail

**Segment 3: East Ridge to Summit (~2 mi, ~3-4 hours)**
- Follow ridge crest upward
- Navigate around several ridge bumps and rocky sections
- **Key features:**
  - **12,900 ft:** Notably loose point - scramble on left (south) side carefully
  - **13,400+ ft:** Bypass two high points rather than summiting them - stay on easier ridge line
  - **13,700-13,900 ft:** Additional rocky pitches
  - **14,196 ft:** Summit

**Descent:**
- Reverse ascent route
- Stay on ridge; do not descend into Silver Creek drainage (north)
- **Winter:** Easier to follow your tracks back

### Critical Navigation Points

**DO:**
- ✅ Follow Colorado Trail for first 3.25 miles
- ✅ Stay on ridge crest above 11,900 ft
- ✅ Bypass high points at 13,400+ ft (don't summit every bump)
- ✅ Use GPS/offline maps above treeline

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Descend into Silver Creek drainage (north side)
- ❌ Attempt to summit every ridge bump (exhausting and unnecessary)
- ❌ Rely solely on trail/visual navigation in winter (snow covers everything)

## Hazards & Risk Assessment

### General Hazards

**Rockfall - Considerable:**
- Loose rock, especially at 12,900 ft point
- Helmets recommended
- Careful foot placement required
- Announce "Rock!" if dislodging

**Route-Finding - Considerable:**
- Trail obscured by snow in winter
- Ridge has multiple bumps and points
- Easy to go wrong direction above treeline
- **Mitigation:** GPS with offline maps (Gaia, CalTopo), compass, map

**Exposure - Moderate:**
- Some sections on ridge have drop-offs
- Not extreme, but fall potential exists
- **Mitigation:** Careful movement, assess conditions

**Commitment - Considerable:**
- 10.5 miles, 5,000 ft gain
- Long day in winter
- Limited bailout options once on ridge
- **Mitigation:** Start early, maintain schedule, enforce turnaround time

### Winter-Specific Hazards

**Avalanche - LOW (Route Avoids Terrain):**
- ✅ Primary advantage: route avoids avalanche terrain
- ✅ Stays on ridge crest above treeline
- ⚠️ Still check CAIC - avoid if HIGH/EXTREME danger
- ⚠️ Do not deviate into bowls or gullies

**Cold & Wind Exposure:**
- Long exposure above treeline
- Summit ridge is wind-scoured
- Wind chills can be extreme
- **Mitigation:** Full winter layering, goggles, balaclava, monitor weather forecast

**Snow Obscuring Route:**
- Trail disappears under snow
- Ridge features less obvious
- Easy to lose route
- **Mitigation:** GPS navigation, study route beforehand, look for tracks from previous parties

**Shorter Daylight:**
- January: ~7:15 AM sunrise, ~5:00 PM sunset (~10 hours daylight)
- February: Slightly longer
- 8-10 hour route = tight margins
- **Mitigation:** Early start (headlamps), strict turnaround time

**Trail Breaking:**
- After heavy snow, trail breaking is exhausting
- Can add hours to trip
- **Mitigation:** Snowshoes, go with group to share work, check recent trip reports

## Typical Timing & Itinerary

### Baseline Time Estimates

**Total Duration:** 8-10 hours car-to-car
- Fast party in good conditions: 7-8 hours
- Average party in average conditions: 8-9 hours
- Slower party or difficult conditions: 10-12 hours

**Segment Times (one-way):**

| Segment | Distance | Elev Change | Typical Time |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| TH to Colorado Trail junction | 3.25 mi | +2,500 ft | 2-3 hours |
| Junction to ridge access | 0.5 mi | +400 ft | 30-45 min |
| Ridge access to summit | ~2 mi | +2,100 ft | 3-4 hours |
| **Total ascent** | ~5.75 mi | +5,000 ft | **5.5-7.5 hours** |
| Descent | 5.75 mi | -5,000 ft | 3-4 hours |

**Note:** Winter travel is slower than summer due to:
- Snow depth (trail breaking)
- Heavier gear
- Shorter daylight (can't push as late)
- Cold affecting pace

### Decision Points

**Typical decision/assessment points:**

1. **Treeline (~11,500 ft):**
   - Time check - on schedule?
   - Weather assessment - conditions deteriorating?
   - Team assessment - everyone doing okay?

2. **Ridge access (~11,900 ft):**
   - Route-finding assessment - can we find the route?
   - Time check - still feasible?

3. **Time-based turnaround:**
   - Typical: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM (depending on start time and daylight)
   - Must allow 3-4 hours for descent
   - Must return before dark (winter sunset ~5:00 PM in January)

### Typical Schedule Example

**For a January attempt (sunrise ~7:15 AM, sunset ~5:00 PM):**

- 4:30 AM: Leave from carpool location
- 7:00 AM: Arrive at trailhead, gear up (at sunrise)
- 7:15 AM: Start hiking
- 9:30-10:00 AM: Reach treeline, assess
- 12:00-12:30 PM: Reach summit (if on pace)
- 12:30-1:00 PM: Start descent
- 4:00-4:30 PM: Return to trailhead (before dark)

**Turnaround time:** 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM (strict, regardless of position)

- User expertise (winter adjustments and turnaround times)

---

## Bailout Options

### Limited Bailout Options

**Primary bailout:** Reverse the ascent route
- Downclimb the ridge back to Colorado Trail
- Follow trail back to trailhead
- Safest and most straightforward

**NOT recommended:**
- Descending north into Silver Creek drainage (difficult terrain, adds distance)
- Attempting to shortcut down other aspects (avalanche terrain, cliffs)

### When to Bail

**Weather-based:**
- Extreme wind (difficult to stand, dangerous wind chills)
- Whiteout conditions (can't see route)
- Incoming storm stronger than forecasted
- Lightning risk (rare in winter, but possible)

**Time-based:**
- Not at treeline by ~9:30 AM (behind schedule)
- Not at ridge by ~10:30 AM (very behind schedule)
- Turnaround time reached (11:30 AM - 12:00 PM typical)

**Team-based:**
- Team member struggling, fatigued, showing signs of hypothermia
- Team member injured
- Team not moving well together
- Someone wants to turn around (listen to that voice)

**Conditions-based:**
- Route-finding impossible (can't find the route)
- Conditions worse than expected (ice, deep snow, etc.)
- Avalanche concerns (saw signs of instability, recent slide, etc.)

**Gut feeling:**
- Something feels wrong
- Conditions don't match expectations
- Risk/reward doesn't feel right
- **Trust your gut - mountains will be there tomorrow**

## Notes & Observations

### Why Choose This Route for Winter

**Advantages:**
1. ✅ Avoids avalanche terrain (primary reason)
2. ✅ Year-round trailhead access
3. ✅ Established route with documentation
4. ✅ Entry-level among winter 14ers

**Trade-offs:**
1. ⚠️ Longer than standard route (10.5 mi vs ~8 mi for SW Slope)
2. ⚠️ More difficult than SW Slope route
3. ⚠️ Considerable route-finding required
4. ⚠️ Commitment - limited bailout options

### Comparison to Other Routes

**vs. Southwest Slope (Standard Route):**
- SW Slope: Shorter, easier, but has avalanche concerns in 11,000-12,000 ft elevation band
- East Ridge: Longer, harder, but avoids avalanche terrain
- **Winter choice:** East Ridge preferred for avalanche safety

**vs. Other Winter 14ers:**
- Easier than: Most technical winter routes
- Similar to: Quandary East Ridge (another beginner-friendly winter route)
- Harder than: Bierstadt West Slopes (gentler terrain)

### Success Factors

**High success rate when:**
- Good weather forecast (manageable temps, low wind)
- CAIC forecast LOW to MODERATE
- Team is fit and experienced with navigation
- Early start (at sunrise or before)
- Recent trail breaking (others have been up recently)

**Low success rate when:**
- Harsh weather (extreme cold, high wind, storm)
- Deep fresh snow without recent trail breaking
- Late start (after 8:00 AM)
- Team unfamiliar with winter navigation
- First major storm of season (unstable conditions)
