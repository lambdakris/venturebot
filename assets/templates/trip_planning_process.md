# The Trip Planning Process: Complete Workflow

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Based On:** Mount Yale winter climb walkthrough and user expertise
**Purpose:** Document the actual process of planning mountaineering trips for agent development

---

## Overview: Two-Phase Planning

Trip planning naturally divides into two distinct phases:

1. **META PLANNING** - Creating reusable "objective blueprints" for peak/route/season combinations
2. **EVENT PLANNING** - Planning specific attempts with temporal details

Each phase has different information sources, decision points, and timelines.

---

## Phase 0: Discovery & Selection (Pre-Meta Planning)

**When:** When you don't yet have a specific objective in mind

**Purpose:** Find and select an objective that matches your criteria

### Process

**Step 1: Define Criteria**
- Skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Season (winter, spring, summer, fall)
- Location (Colorado, PNW, etc.)
- Hazard preferences (avoid avalanche terrain, avoid exposure, etc.)
- Other constraints (distance from home, accessibility, etc.)

**Step 2: Survey Available Objectives**
- **Primary resources:**
  - 14ers.com (for Colorado)
  - SummitPost (broader coverage)
  - Guidebooks (Roach's Colorado 14ers, etc.)
  - Web searches for regional resources

- **Search methods:**
  - Keyword searches ("winter 14ers avoid avalanche terrain")
  - Browse by region/difficulty
  - Articles and curated lists (e.g., "winter 14ers for beginners")

**Step 3: Compare Options**
- Difficulty (class rating, technical requirements)
- Accessibility (trailhead access, permits, closures)
- Safety (avalanche terrain, exposure, objective hazards)
- Logistics (distance, typical duration)

**Step 4: Select Objective**
- Choose one that best matches criteria
- Document rationale for selection

### Example: Mount Yale Selection

**Criteria:** "14ers in Colorado, winter routes, avoid avalanche terrain, entry-level"

**Survey:** Web search → 14ers.com winter beginners article

**Options Found:** Yale, Quandary, others

**Selection:** Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter
- **Rationale:**
  - Entry-level winter 14er
  - East Ridge avoids avalanche terrain
  - Trailhead typically accessible in winter
  - Documented route with good information

**Key Resource:** https://www.14ers.com/winter-14ers-for-beginners.php?p=8

---

## Phase 1: Meta Planning - Creating the Objective Blueprint

**When:** After selecting an objective, before planning a specific attempt

**Purpose:** Gather stable, reusable information about the objective

**Output:** Meta plan document (e.g., "Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter.md")

### Step 1: Initial Research - Route & Access

**Information to gather:**
- Route description (turn-by-turn)
- Distance and elevation gain
- Class/difficulty rating
- Trailhead location and access
- Season-specific considerations
- Typical timing estimates

**Information sources (by priority):**

1. **Established route databases:**
   - 14ers.com route pages (general route info)
   - 14ers.com trailhead pages (access, winter accessibility)
   - SummitPost (route descriptions)
   - Mountain Project (technical routes)

2. **Season-specific articles:**
   - 14ers.com winter articles (limited coverage)
   - Blog posts and articles (broader coverage)
   - Guidebook winter sections

3. **Trip reports (for META patterns):**
   - Look for consistent patterns across multiple reports
   - Typical conditions, typical gear, typical timing
   - Known hazards and challenges

**Key insight:** Information is often fragmented across multiple pages/sources. You must:
- Know to look for trailhead pages separately from route pages
- Search for season-specific articles beyond main route page
- Synthesize information from disparate sources

**For Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter:**
- Route page: https://www.14ers.com/route.php?route=yale2 (general route)
- Trailhead page: https://www.14ers.com/php14ers/trailheadsview.php?thparm=sw23 (winter access!)
- Winter article: https://www.14ers.com/winter-14ers-for-beginners.php?p=8 (winter-specific beta)

### Step 2: Hazard Assessment

**Identify typical hazards for this objective/season:**

**General mountaineering hazards:**
- Exposure (fall potential)
- Rockfall
- Route-finding difficulty
- Weather exposure
- Commitment level
- Altitude/elevation

**Season-specific hazards:**
- Winter: Cold, wind, avalanche, shorter days, snow obscuring route
- Spring: Wet avalanches, postholing, stream crossings
- Summer: Lightning, afternoon storms, heat, crowding
- Fall: Early winter storms, unpredictable conditions

**Route-specific hazards:**
- Technical sections (rappels, exposed scrambling)
- Loose rock
- Water crossings
- Glacier hazards (if applicable)

**Avalanche terrain assessment (critical for winter/spring):**
- Does route cross avalanche terrain?
- Can avalanche terrain be avoided?
- What aspects are exposed to avalanche hazard?
- Are there safe alternatives?

**For Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter:**
- ✅ Avalanche terrain AVOIDED (primary advantage of East Ridge)
- ⚠️ Route-finding "considerable" (per 14ers.com)
- ⚠️ Exposure "moderate"
- ⚠️ Rockfall "considerable" (loose rock at 12,900 ft)
- ⚠️ Winter weather exposure above treeline
- ⚠️ Long route (10.5 mi, 5,000 ft) = commitment

### Step 3: Difficulty Assessment

**Classify the objective:**
- Class rating (YDS: Class 1-5)
- Technical requirements (ice axe, crampons, rope, etc.)
- Fitness requirements (distance, elevation gain)
- Experience requirements (navigation, winter skills, etc.)
- Overall difficulty for season (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

**Determine standard gear:**
- What's typically needed?
- What's season-specific?
- What's route-specific?

**For Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter:**
- Class 2 (non-technical scrambling)
- Intermediate for winter
- Considerable route-finding required
- 10.5 mi, 5,000 ft (significant fitness requirement)
- Standard winter gear (microspikes, layers, navigation)
- Optional but recommended: ice axe, crampons, snowshoes (depending on conditions)

### Step 4: Route Details & Navigation

**Document turn-by-turn route:**
- Starting point
- Key waypoints
- Navigation challenges
- Where to go, where NOT to go
- Landmarks and decision points

**Season-specific route variations:**
- Winter: Stay on ridge vs summer trail variation
- Spring: Avoid snow-loaded slopes
- Summer: Standard trail vs scrambling variations

**Bailout options:**
- Where can you safely retreat?
- Alternative descent routes
- Decision points for bailing

**For Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter:**
- Start: Avalanche TH (9,400 ft)
- Follow Colorado Trail north 3.25 mi to ~11,900 ft
- Leave trail, traverse west to access east ridge
- Follow ridge crest to summit
- Key challenges: Route-finding above treeline, loose rock at 12,900 ft
- Bailout: Reverse route (no easy alternatives)

### Step 5: Typical Timing & Itinerary

**Estimate typical times:**
- Segment-by-segment timing
- Total duration range
- Factors that affect timing (snow depth, fitness, conditions)

**Identify decision points:**
- Where should you assess conditions?
- Where are turnaround points?
- What's a reasonable turnaround time?

**For Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter:**
- Typical duration: 8-10 hours (winter is slower than summer)
- Segments: TH→ridge junction (~2-3 hrs), ridge→summit (~3-4 hrs), descent (~3-4 hrs)
- Decision points: Treeline (assess weather), ridge access (assess route-finding), time-based turnaround
- Typical turnaround: 11 AM - 12 PM (winter daylight is short)

### Step 6: Emergency Information (Jurisdictional)

**Gather static emergency info:**
- County jurisdiction
- Sheriff/SAR contact (non-emergency)
- Nearest hospital
- Land manager (Forest Service, NPS, etc.)
- Wilderness regulations

**This is META because it doesn't change:**

**For Mount Yale:**
- Chaffee County
- Collegiate Peaks Wilderness
- Nearest hospital: TBD
- SAR: Chaffee County SAR (via 911)

### Step 7: Standard Resources & References

**Document useful resources:**
- Route descriptions
- Trip reports (representative samples)
- Maps (CalTopo, USGS)
- Guidebook pages
- Articles and beta

**For Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter:**
- 14ers.com route page, trailhead page, winter article
- SummitPost (if applicable)
- Historical trip reports showing typical conditions

## Phase 2: Event Planning - Planning the Specific Attempt

**When:** After meta plan exists, when planning a specific attempt

**Purpose:** Apply temporal information to plan a safe, realistic attempt

**Output:** Event plan document (e.g., "Mount Yale East Ridge - Winter - 2026-01-17.md")

### Step 1: Set Basic Parameters

**Define the attempt:**
- Specific date
- Participants (names, skills, emergency contacts)
- Logistics (carpool time/location, trailhead time)

**For Mount Yale - Jan 17, 2026:**
- Date: January 17, 2026
- Participants: TBD
- Carpool: 4:30 AM at TBD location
- Trailhead: 7:00 AM at Avalanche TH

### Step 2: Assess Team Capability

**Match team to objective:**
- Do participants have required skills?
- Fitness level appropriate?
- Experience with this type of objective?
- Comfort with hazards (exposure, avalanche terrain, etc.)?

**This is EVENT because it's specific to WHO is going:**

**Decision gate:** If team doesn't match objective, either:
- Choose different objective (back to Discovery)
- Add training/preparation
- Recruit different/additional team members

### Step 3: Conditions Monitoring & Assessment

**This is the most complex and sophisticated part of event planning.**

#### Timeline-Based Monitoring Strategy

**~11+ days out (when objective is selected):**
- Note upcoming storms/weather systems
- Begin casual monitoring
- Not yet actionable for planning

**~10 days out (when forecasts become available):**
- Start checking weather forecasts
- Begin monitoring avalanche forecast trends
- Assess early feasibility
- Consider developing Plan B objectives

**~7-5 days out:**
- More serious monitoring
- Refine understanding of weather pattern
- Check for trip reports post-storm
- Make preliminary Plan B decision if needed

**~3-2 days out:**
- Deep dive on conditions
- Final weather forecast
- Final avalanche forecast
- Search broadly for recent trip reports
- Check quantitative data (SNOTEL, etc.)
- Make final go/no-go decision

**Night before:**
- Final weather check
- Final avalanche forecast check
- Any last-minute trip reports
- Confirm or abort

**Morning of:**
- Final weather check
- Final avalanche forecast check
- Commit or bail

#### Monitoring Intensity by Objective Type

**HIGH Avalanche Concern Objectives** (couloirs, backcountry skiing, steep snow):
- 📊 **Intensive monitoring required**
- Track expected AND actual precipitation (snowfall amounts)
- Track wind patterns (speed, direction, duration)
- Model where/how snow was deposited (wind loading on specific aspects)
- Track temperature patterns (freeze-thaw cycles, consolidation potential)
- Validate predictions against CAIC forecast evolution
- Build area-specific mental model of snowpack
- Look for signs of instability (whumpfing, cracking, recent avalanches)
- **Required conditions:** Typically need LOW avalanche danger
- **Abort triggers:** Moderate or higher danger, recent loading, poor consolidation

**LOW Avalanche Concern Objectives** (ridge routes avoiding avy terrain):
- 📊 **Moderate monitoring required**
- Watch for HIGH or EXTREME avalanche danger (still avoid even on low-concern routes)
- Focus on weather for exposure management (cold, wind, precipitation)
- Track storm systems for trail-breaking concerns (massive new snow = exhausting trail breaking)
- Less intensive than high-concern objectives
- **Required conditions:** Not HIGH/EXTREME danger; manageable weather
- **Abort triggers:** HIGH+ avalanche danger, extreme weather (wind chills, whiteout)

#### Information Sources by Category

**Weather Forecasts:**
- NOAA Point Forecast (7-10 day, detailed)
- Mountain Forecast (summit-specific conditions)
- OpenSnow (snowfall forecasts, easy-to-read)
- Weather Underground (hourly details)
- Windy.com (wind patterns visualization)

**Avalanche Forecasts:**
- CAIC (Colorado Avalanche Information Center) - daily updates by 4:30 PM
  - Overall danger rating (below treeline, near treeline, above treeline)
  - Avalanche problems (wind slab, persistent slab, wet loose, etc.)
  - Travel advice
  - Snowpack summary
- Regional forecasts updated daily
- Check for your specific zone (Sawatch, Front Range, etc.)

**Quantitative Snow Data:**
- SNOTEL stations (snow depth, SWE, temperature)
- Extrapolate from nearby stations at similar elevation/aspect
- Track trends over time

**Recent Conditions (Trip Reports):**
- **14ers.com** (primary for Colorado)
  - Trip reports section
  - Peak conditions updates
  - Forum discussions
- **Reddit** (r/Mountaineering, r/14ers, regional subs)
- **Facebook groups** (14ers.com FP group, regional climbing groups)
- **SummitPost** (trip reports)
- **AllTrails** (reviews/conditions)
- **Personal blogs** (thevirtualsherpa.com, many others)
- **Instagram/YouTube** (search hashtags, recent videos)

**Road/Access Conditions:**
- CoTrip.org / CO511 (Colorado road conditions)
- Forest Service websites (seasonal closures)
- Recent trip reports (did they make it to the TH?)

#### Handling Incomplete Information

**Reality:** You often won't have perfect information. Options:

**1. Weather-Based Modeling:**
- Study weather history (past week's temps, precip, wind)
- Build mental model of likely conditions
- Forecast forward based on upcoming weather

**2. Historical Comparison:**
- Find trip reports from similar timeframes (same peak, same month, similar snow year)
- Take with grain of salt (this year is not last year)
- Balance with current weather modeling

**3. Quantitative Extrapolation:**
- Use SNOTEL data from nearby stations
- Extrapolate based on elevation/aspect differences
- Understand typical snowpack for the season

**4. Multi-Source Search:**
- Don't limit yourself to one website
- Cast a wide net (14ers.com, Reddit, Facebook, SummitPost, AllTrails, blogs, etc.)
- Recent reports (within 1-2 weeks) are most valuable

**5. Informed Assumptions:**
- Plan for typical winter conditions
- Bring just-in-case items (snowshoes, ice axe, crampons)
- Go with "check and see" mindset
- Be willing to turn back if conditions don't match expectations

#### Understanding Snow Consolidation (Gross Simplification)

**Factors AGAINST consolidation (unstable snowpack):**
- Continued snowfall (loading)
- High winds (wind loading, slab formation)
- Cold temperatures (snow doesn't bond)
- Rapid temperature changes
- No time for settling

**Factors FOR consolidation (more stable snowpack):**
- Time without new loading (several days)
- Freeze-thaw cycles (snow bonds and strengthens)
- Warm days + cold nights
- Gentle warming trend
- Sunshine on slopes

**Critical caveat:** Snow science is HIGHLY complex. These are broad strokes only. Always:
- Contrast your model with CAIC forecast evolution
- Look for expert assessment in avalanche forecasts
- When in doubt, avoid avalanche terrain or abort
- This is NOT a substitute for avalanche education

### Step 4: Detailed Itinerary & Timing

**Create specific timeline:**
- Incorporate actual sunrise/sunset times for the date
- Calculate drive time to trailhead
- Estimate segment times based on:
  - META baseline timing
  - Current conditions (snow depth, trail breaking, etc.)
  - Team fitness
  - Season (winter is slower)
- Set specific turnaround time
  - Based on daylight hours
  - Based on weather window
  - Based on typical timing for route
- Decision points with specific times

**For Mount Yale - Jan 17, 2026:**
- Sunrise: ~7:15 AM
- Sunset: ~5:00 PM
- Carpool: 4:30 AM (allows buffer for delays)
- Trailhead: 7:00 AM (at sunrise)
- Turnaround time: TBD based on conditions, but likely 11 AM - 12 PM
- Return to cars: Target 4:00 PM (before dark)

### Step 5: Gear Finalization

**Start with META baseline gear, adjust for EVENT conditions:**

**Adjustments based on:**
- Specific weather forecast (colder = more layers, wind = goggles/balaclava)
- Snow conditions (deep snow = definitely bring snowshoes, icy = crampons)
- Recent trip reports (what did others need?)
- Team composition (do we have all group gear covered?)

**Assign group gear:**
- Who's bringing rope? (if needed)
- Who's bringing first aid kit?
- Who's bringing InReach/PLB?
- Ensure redundancy for critical items (navigation, first aid, shelter)

**For Mount Yale - Jan 17, 2026:**
- Check forecast for specific temps/wind
- Adjust layers accordingly
- Decide on snowshoes (check recent reports, SNOTEL depth)
- Ice axe + crampons (bringing for practice even if not strictly required)
- Assign group gear once team is finalized

### Step 6: Logistics Coordination

**Confirm specific details:**
- Exact carpool location and time
- Who's driving?
- Trailhead arrival time
- Participant contact info
- Emergency contact info for each participant
- Communication plan (InReach check-ins, etc.)

**Verify access:**
- Is trailhead road actually passable? (check recent reports, road conditions)
- Parking availability?
- Any permits needed? (usually not for day trips, but check)

### Step 7: Final Go/No-Go Decision

**Decision gates:**

**3-2 days before:**
- Weather forecast acceptable?
- Avalanche forecast acceptable?
- Conditions reports acceptable?
- Team still committed and healthy?
- **Activate Plan B if needed**

**Night before:**
- Final conditions check
- Any last-minute changes?
- Confirm or abort

**Morning of:**
- Final weather/avalanche check
- How does everyone feel?
- Commit or bail
- **No shame in bailing - mountains will be there**

**Criteria for GO:**
- Weather forecast manageable (no extreme cold, extreme wind, whiteout)
- Avalanche forecast not HIGH/EXTREME (even for low-concern route)
- Team capable and healthy
- Logistics sorted
- Gut feeling is good

**Criteria for NO-GO:**
- Harsh weather forecast (extreme conditions)
- HIGH or EXTREME avalanche danger
- Team concerns (illness, injury, lack of preparedness)
- Access issues (road closed, parking unavailable)
- Gut feeling says no (trust your instincts)

## Key Decision Points & Iteration

### When Planning Loops Back

**Discovery → Selection:**
- If no objectives match criteria, refine criteria or expand search

**Meta Planning → Discovery:**
- If objective is too hard/dangerous, go back and select different objective

**Event Planning → Meta Planning:**
- If conditions never align for this objective, maybe wrong season/route

**Event Planning → Discovery:**
- Most common: conditions poor for this objective, user starts over with different objective using the agent

**Event Planning → Discovery:**
- If entire trip window has poor conditions, might need to wait for better season

### Critical Decision Gates

**Gate 1: Objective Selection**
- Does this match my criteria?
- Is it appropriate for my skill level?
- **Abort:** If no, return to discovery

**Gate 2: Team Capability**
- Does the team have required skills?
- **Abort:** If no, change objective or team

**Gate 3: Conditions Assessment (~1 week out)**
- Are conditions trending favorable?
- **Abort:** If no, user can start over with different objective

**Gate 4: Final Go/No-Go (night before / morning of)**
- Weather acceptable?
- Avalanche acceptable?
- Team ready?
- Gut check?
- **Abort:** If any no, postpone or choose different objective

**Gate 5: In-Field Decisions (during the trip)**
- Conditions as expected?
- Team performing well?
- On schedule?
- **Abort:** If no, turn around (this is EVENT-day decision making, not planning)

## Special Considerations

### Winter-Specific Planning

**Additional hazards:**
- Avalanche (primary concern)
- Cold exposure / frostbite
- Shorter daylight hours
- Snow obscuring route
- Trail breaking (exhausting)

**Additional gear:**
- Microspikes, crampons, ice axe
- Snowshoes
- Extra insulation
- Goggles, balaclava
- Insulated water bottles

**Different mindset:**
- More conservative turnaround times
- Higher abort threshold
- Avalanche awareness paramount
- Check and see approach

### High Avalanche Terrain

**If objective crosses avalanche terrain:**
- Formal avalanche education REQUIRED
- Intensive conditions monitoring
- Build mental model of snowpack
- Typically need LOW danger
- Field observations and decisions critical
- Rescue gear required (beacon, probe, shovel)

### Technical Routes

**If objective requires technical skills:**
- Rope systems
- Anchors and protection
- Rappel procedures
- Partner skills matched
- Group gear coordinated
- Rescue plan established

---

## Agent Implications

**The agent needs to:**

1. **Understand the two-phase structure** (meta vs event)
2. **Guide discovery** (help find objectives matching criteria)
3. **Synthesize fragmented information** (route pages + trailhead pages + articles)
4. **Model conditions** (not just look up, but reason about weather/snow)
5. **Search broadly** (many sources for trip reports and beta)
6. **Differentiate monitoring strategy** (high vs low avalanche concern)
7. **Build timelines** (what to check when)
8. **Apply judgment** (when information is incomplete)
9. **Provide nuanced guidance** (consolidation dynamics, abort criteria)
10. **Embrace uncertainty** (check and see mindset, be willing to turn back)
11. **Track over time** (monitor forecast evolution, not single snapshot)

**Note:** Plan B/C/D development is **user responsibility**. If conditions don't work for an objective, the user simply uses the agent again to plan a different objective. The agent focuses on planning ONE objective well.

---

## Conclusion

Trip planning is **sophisticated, iterative, and requires judgment**. It's not a simple lookup task.

The agent must:
- Understand mountaineering principles
- Synthesize multi-source information
- Model and reason about conditions
- Provide context-aware guidance
- Adapt to objective type (avy concern, difficulty, season)
- Support decision-making over time

This process document captures the real workflow of experienced mountaineers and provides the foundation for building an agent that truly understands trip planning.

**Next steps:**
1. Use this process to create the Mount Yale META plan
2. Use this process to create the Mount Yale EVENT plan (Jan 17)
3. Design agent architecture that follows this workflow
4. Build evaluators that check process adherence
